# SICP

I have decided to brush up on my programming skills from the minor I received in CS while in my undergraduate program 4 years ago.

I found the website https://teachyourselfcs.com/ which suggested this book: "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman.

After reading through the first chapter I decided to create this repository as a way to keep track of and share my progress working through the examples and exercises.

I will be using DrRacket (https://racket-lang.org/) with the sicp package (https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/) to run the scheme dialect of lisp.
